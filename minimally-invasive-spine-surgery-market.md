<p><strong>The Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spine fusion procedure</li><li>Spine non-fusion procedure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The minimally invasive spine surgery market serves two main applications: spine fusion and non-fusion procedures. Spine fusion procedures involve surgically joining two or more vertebrae to stabilize the spine, often addressing conditions like herniated discs or spinal deformities. In contrast, non-fusion procedures focus on relieving pain and restoring mobility without permanently merging bones, utilizing techniques such as discectomy or vertebroplasty. Both approaches aim to reduce recovery time, minimize tissue damage, and enhance patient outcomes.</p></p>
