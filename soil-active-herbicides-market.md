<p><strong>The Soil Active Herbicides Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Plamt</li><li>Pre-Emergence</li><li>Post-Emergence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The soil active herbicides market is categorized based on application timing: pre-plant, pre-emergence, and post-emergence. Pre-plant herbicides are applied before planting to control weeds in the soil. Pre-emergence herbicides target weeds before they germinate, creating a barrier that prevents their growth. Post-emergence herbicides are used after crops and weeds have emerged, targeting actively growing weeds. These applications are crucial for enhancing crop yield and managing weed resistance effectively in agricultural practices.</p></p>
